    Hi! I’m Kelly, a web design student at Seattle Central currently in my third quarter. While my goal is a tech career somewhere in the design and/or front-end development realm, my specific path between these two areas remains to be determined. I enjoy doing both quite a bit! <br>
   <br>
    For now, the focus is to learn as much as I possibly can while navigating the ups and downs of new concepts and subjects. Documented here are pieces of that process.</p>
   <p class="p2">
    Beyond my school life, I love to write and do photography. Another love is traveling, which can involve any one or a combination of these: a walk, a hike, a camping trip, road-trip, short-flight, long-flight. All travel excites me, regardless of the destination or trip size.</p>
